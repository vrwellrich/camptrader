  <p>This policy explains how the <strong>Camp Trader</strong> Android app (“App”) collects, uses, and shares information. By using the App, you agree to this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. We Don’t Sell Data</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade personal information.</p>

  <h2>2. What We Collect (and Why)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong> (e.g., email, display name) – create and manage your account, authentication, and support. <em>Required for accounts.</em></li>
    <li><strong>User-generated content</strong> (listings, messages, photos) – provide marketplace and communication features. <em>Required when you use these features.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (truncated coordinates when you add a location to a listing) – show listings in a general area. <em>Optional; only collected if you include location.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Device or other IDs</strong> (e.g., Firebase Installation ID / messaging token) – notifications, app integrity, security/fraud prevention. <em>Required for reliable service and push.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Crash logs & diagnostics</strong> (e.g., Crashlytics/Android vitals) – troubleshoot crashes and improve performance. <em>Collected automatically when the app runs.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Optional vs. Required</h2>
  <p>Some data is necessary for core functionality (e.g., account data, certain device IDs). Location is optional and collected only if you attach it to a listing.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and secure the App (accounts, listings, messaging, notifications)</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud/abuse; debug and fix crashes; measure performance and reliability</li>
    <li>Communicate about service updates or support issues</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising or profiling.</p>

  <h2>5. Location Display for Listings</h2>
  <p>By default, the App displays <strong>truncated</strong> coordinates (about two decimals ≈ 1.1 km radius) to reduce precision; this reduces—but does not eliminate—the ability to infer an exact location. You may voluntarily share precise details in messages at your own discretion. If you prefer not to share location, don’t include it in listings and avoid disclosing it in chats.</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing & Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We share data only with <strong>service providers</strong> acting on our behalf and under our instructions, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase/Google Cloud</strong> – hosting, authentication, messaging</li>
    <li><strong>Crashlytics/Android vitals</strong> – crash reporting and diagnostics</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> – if purchases are made in-app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Providers receive only the minimum necessary data and may not use it for their own purposes. We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard safeguards and <strong>encrypt data in transit</strong>. No method is 100% secure; avoid posting highly sensitive information in listings or messages.</p>

  <h2>8. Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. You can request account/data deletion or access/correction by emailing <a href="mailto:support@camptrader.app">support@camptrader.app</a> or via the in-app delete option (where available). We will verify your identity and process requests in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>9. Cookies / Web Views</h2>
  <p>The Android App does not use cookies for ads or analytics. Our website (or in-app WebViews) may use strictly necessary cookies for basic operation; we do not use cookies for cross-site tracking.</p>

  <h2>10. Children</h2>
  <p>Camp Trader is <strong>not directed to children</strong>. If our target audience changes, we will update this policy and our practices.</p>

  <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location (e.g., California, EU), you may have rights to access, delete, or correct your personal data. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and revise the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
