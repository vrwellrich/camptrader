  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Camp Trader mobile application and related services (the “App” or “Service”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for individuals aged <strong>18 years or older</strong>. If you are under 18, you must not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2) Accounts & Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for your account, credentials, and all activity under it.</li>
    <li>Provide accurate information and keep it updated. Notify us of any unauthorized use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) User Content & License</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of content you submit (e.g., listings, photos, messages). You grant Camp Trader a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, and display that content to operate and improve the Service. You confirm you have the necessary rights and that your content does not infringe others’ rights.</p>

  <h2>4) Listings, Interactions, and Transactions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are solely responsible for your listings and interactions with other users.</li>
    <li>Camp Trader is not a party to user-to-user transactions and does not guarantee buyers, sellers, pricing, quality, or completion.</li>
    <li>Comply with all applicable laws (including taxes and prohibited items).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Location Information</h2>
  <p>Listing locations may be shown using <strong>truncated</strong> coordinates to reduce precision. Truncation reduces—but does not eliminate—the possibility of inferring an exact location. Do not post precise addresses or coordinates unless you choose to share them. See the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>6) Payments</h2>
  <p>If in-app purchases or subscriptions are offered, billing is handled by Google Play and subject to Google Play’s terms and refund policies. Promotional credits (if any) have no cash value and may be modified or discontinued.</p>

  <h2>7) Prohibited Conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Illegal, fraudulent, misleading, or harmful activity</li>
    <li>Infringing, defamatory, obscene, or harassing content; doxxing</li>
    <li>Attempting to access others’ accounts or personal information</li>
    <li>Interfering with the Service, scraping, reverse engineering, or bypassing security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Except for user content, the Service and materials we provide are protected by intellectual-property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our permission.</p>

  <h2>9) “As-Is” Service; No Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided on an <strong>“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”</strong> basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Camp Trader disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, availability, non-infringement, and compatibility with your device.</p>

  <h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Camp Trader and its affiliates, licensors, and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; or for any loss of data, profits, revenue, goodwill, or business opportunities; arising from or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the greater of (a) amounts you paid to us for the Service in the six months before the claim, or (b) USD $50.</p>

  <h2>11) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including violations of these Terms. You may stop using the Service at any time. To request account/data deletion, see <a href="delete-account.html">Delete Account</a>.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
  <p>We may modify the Service or these Terms. We will post updates here with a revised “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>13) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may integrate third-party services (e.g., Firebase, Crashlytics, Google Play Billing, maps). Their terms and privacy policies govern your use of those services.</p>

  <h2>14) Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. You and Camp Trader consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in California for disputes not subject to arbitration.</p>

  <h2>15) Arbitration & Class-Action Waiver (if applicable)</h2>
  <p>To the extent permitted by law, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration; class or representative actions are not permitted; and you and Camp Trader waive the right to a jury trial. If this clause is found unenforceable, §14 applies.</p>

  <h2>16) Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Camp Trader.</li>
    <li>If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.</li>
    <li>You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.</li>
  </ul>
