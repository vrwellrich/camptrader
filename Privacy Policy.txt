1) Scope

This policy describes how the Camp Trader Android app collects, uses, and shares data. (Our website may use additional web-only technologies like cookies; see §10.)

2) We Don’t Sell Data

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information.

3) Data We Collect (and Why)

Account data (e.g., email, display name): create/manage your account, authentication, customer support. (Required for accounts.)

User-generated content (listings, messages, photos): provide core marketplace features. (Required when you use these features.)

Approximate location (truncated coordinates when you add a location to a listing): show listings near a general area. (Optional; collected only if you choose to include location.)

Device or other IDs (e.g., Firebase Installation ID / messaging token): push notifications, app integrity, security/fraud prevention. (Required for notifications and service reliability.)

App performance data

Crash logs & Diagnostics (e.g., Crashlytics): troubleshoot crashes, improve stability/performance. (Collected automatically by our crash/perf SDK when the app runs.)

4) Optional vs. Required

Some data is required for core functionality (e.g., account data, certain device/SDK identifiers). Location is optional and collected only if you include it with a listing.

5) Location Display for Listings

By default, we display truncated coordinates (≈ two decimals, ~1.1 km radius) to reduce precision; this helps reduce—but does not eliminate—the ability to infer an exact location. You may voluntarily share a more precise location in chats; that disclosure is your choice.

If you prefer not to share location, don’t include it in listings and avoid disclosing it in messages.

6) How We Use Data

Provide and secure the app, enable listings/messaging, and deliver notifications

Diagnose, prevent, and address crashes, security, and abuse

Improve performance and reliability
We do not use your data for advertising or profiling.

7) Sharing & Service Providers (Processors)

We share data only with service providers that process it on our behalf and under our instructions, such as:

Firebase/Google Cloud (hosting, authentication, messaging), Crashlytics (crash reporting)

Google Play Billing (if purchases are made in-app)
Providers receive only the minimum necessary data and may not use it for their own purposes.
We may also disclose data if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.

8) Security

We use industry-standard safeguards and encrypt data in transit. No method is 100% secure; avoid posting highly sensitive information in listings or chats.

9) Retention & Deletion

We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. You can request account/data deletion or access/correction at support@camptrader.app
 (or via in-app request where available). We’ll verify your identity and respond per applicable laws.

10) Cookies / Web Views

The Android app does not use cookies for ads or analytics. Our website (or in-app WebViews) may use strictly necessary cookies for basic operation. We do not use cookies for cross-site tracking.

11) Children

Camp Trader is not directed to children. If your target audience includes children in the future, we will update our practices and disclosures accordingly.

12) Changes

We may update this policy. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy. We will indicate the “Last updated” date above.
